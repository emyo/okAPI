    "# How do I _copy_ a file from another one of _my projects_?\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Files are stored on the Platform in two spaces: [Public Reference Files](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/file-repositories) and projects of which you're a member. Files can be copied from these two repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Here, we focus on **copying a file from your own project**. [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/copy-a-file)]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "1. We'll list all our projects to find our source and target projects.\n",
    "2. Then, we'll list the files within the two projects.\n",
    "3. Lastly, we'll copy a file from the source project to the target project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of at least one project. Learn more about creating a new project. [[recipe](projects_makeNew.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-project)].\n",
    " 2. You need your **authentication token** and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">Setup_API_environment.ipynb</a> for details. Learn more about [obtaining your authentication token](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-your-authentication-token).\n",
    " 3. You understand how to list projects of which you are a member. We will use this call directly to select a project below. [[recipe](projects_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-your-projects)]\n",
    " 5. You understand how to list files within a project. We will use this call below and select a file. [[recipe](files_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-files-primary-method)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as with all okAPI recipes, this recipe makes use of the [Seven Bridges Public API Python library](../Tutorials/SBPLAT/Setup_API_environment.ipynb)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Imports\n",
